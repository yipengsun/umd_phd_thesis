\section{Auxiliary samples}
\label{ref:sel:aux}

A $\Bp \rightarrow \jpsi \Kp$ sample is used to derive $B$ kinematic and
multiplicity corrections to MC samples.
The data sample is selected from \mup\mun\Kp final states, with the \mup\mun
pair at \jpsi resonance,
and the invariant mass of the 3-particle final state around the reference mass
of \Bp.
The MC sample used to compare with $\jpsi \Kp$ data is selected with the same
procedure, with total production number after filtering\footnote{
    This is also referred as ``event on disk''.
} listed in \cref{tab:add-mc-samples}.
The procedure is described in \cref{ref:mc-cor:init:jpsi-k}.

A simulated $\Dz \rightarrow \Km \pip$ MC sample,
also listed in \cref{tab:add-mc-samples},
is requested to model the momentum smearing in the misID sample due to
$K, \pi$ decay-in-flight into an authentic \muon,
which is described in \cref{ref:fit:tmpl:misid:dif}.
