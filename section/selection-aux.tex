\section{Auxiliary samples}
\label{ref:sel:aux}

A $\Bp \rightarrow \jpsi \Kp$ sample is used to derive $B$ kinematic and
multiplicity corrections to MC.
The data sample is reconstructed from the
\smalltt{StrippingBetaSBu2JpsiKDetachedLine}, and fitted with
a \sPlot procedure.
The MC sample used to compare with $\jpsi \Kp$ data is listed in
\cref{tab:add-mc-samples}.
The procedure is described in \cref{sec:data-mc:init-rwt:jpsi-k-correction}.

A simulated $\Dz \rightarrow \Km \pip$ MC sample,
also listed in \cref{tab:add-mc-samples},
is requested to model the momentum smearing in the misID sample due to
decay-in-flight effect, which is described in
\cref{sec:data-driven-templates:mu-misid:dif}.
