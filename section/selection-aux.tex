\section{Auxiliary samples}
\label{ref:sel:aux}

A $\Bp \rightarrow \jpsi \Kp$ sample is used to derive $B$ kinematic and
multiplicity corrections
(\cref{ref:mc-cor:init:jpsi-k})
to MC samples.
The data sample is selected by requiring
two \muon at the \jpsi resonance forming a vertex with another \kaon,
and the invariant mass of the \mup\mun\Kp final state around the reference mass
of \Bp.
The offline selection cuts for $\jpsi\Kp$ are listed in
\cref{tab:cut-jpsik}.
The MC sample used to compare with $\jpsi \Kp$ data is selected with the same
procedure, with PID cuts applied as weights\footnote{
    The weights are obtained from \pidcalib, with a method similar to that in
    \cref{ref:mc-emulation:pid}.

    An extended PID binning range is chosen to cover as much phase space of
    \kaon and \muon as possible.
    There may still be events outside the covering region, in which case the PID
    weights from nearby bin is applied,
    to avoid explicit cuts on the \jpsi\kaon data control sample.
}.
The number of MC events after filtering\footnote{
    This is also referred as ``event on disk''.
} is listed in \cref{tab:add-mc-samples}.
