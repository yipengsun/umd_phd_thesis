\section{Efficiency ratios}
\label{ref:fit:eff}

Similar to the run 1 \RDX pathfinder analysis,
this analysis employs four efficiency ratios to relate yields between
various signal and normalization decay modes for extracting \RDX from fitted
values and cross-constraining the $B \rightarrow D^{*0/*+}\ellm\neulb$ feed
downs in the \Dz channel.
These ratios are:

\paragraph{For \RD}
There is only one ratio for \RD:
