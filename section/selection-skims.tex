\section{Signal (ISO) and control background (1OS, 2OS, DD) skims and the isolation BDT}
\label{ref:sel:skims}

The signal and control skims (sub-samples) are separated by inspecting if there
are additional charged tracks in the event that are likely originating from the
same decay vertex (typically a $B$ decay vertex, and will be referred as so in
later text) as the reconstructed \DXmu pair;
if there is no such track,
the \DXmu pair is considered \emph{isolated} and is placed in the signal skim;
otherwise it is categorized as one of the control skims.

\paragraph{The isolation BDT}
A multivariate BDT,
referred as the ``isolation BDT'',
conceptually identical to the one used in \cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056},
is trained on LHCb run 2 simulation
with training variables listed in \cref{tab:iso-bdt-input},
to provide a score-based estimation on if a charged track is originating from
the \B (\DXmu) vertex or not.

there
exists additional charged tracks that are compatible with coming from the
reconstructed \B vertex.
The isolation BDT, described in \cref{ref:sel:tech:iso-bdt}, provides an
estimation on how likely a nearby charged track comes from the same \B vertex.

Below a brief description for the signal sample and the main physics background
control samples is provided.
The dominate decay mode for each skim is also listed; these skims still contain
a composition of many decay modes.
The actual isolation selections are listed in \cref{tab:skim-cut}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ISO: $B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \lepton \neulb$, with $\lepton \in \{\muon,
        \tauon\}$.
        This is referred as signal, or ``isolated'', sample.
        It requires that no additional charged track is from the \B vertex
        (in a probabilistic sense, with probability related to the isolation
        score)
        and is compatible with a fully reconstructed \B decay
        (ignoring missing neutrino(s)).
        % TODO: Maybe list yield, and compare to run 1, and include figures?

    \item 1OS: $B \rightarrow D^{**} \lepton \neulb$.
        This control sample, enriched in excited charm states,
        requires one and only one additional anti-isolated charged long track
        that is compatible with a \pion PID hypothesis and has correct charge
        for a $D^{**} \rightarrow D^{(*+)}\pim$ decay.

    \item 2OS: $B \rightarrow D^{**}_H \lepton \neulb$,
        where $H$ stands for ``heavy''.
        This control sample is enriched in highly excited (heavy) charm states,
        which is selected by requiring two and only two anti-isolated \pion-like
        long tracks of opposite charge,
        capable of $D^{**}_H \rightarrow D^{(*)} \pip\pim$ decay.

        % Why?
        This sample also provides an independent selection of
        $B \rightarrow D^{(*)}D X$ backgrounds, where the \pip\pim fit into the
        $X$ category and \kaon escapes isolation detection.

    \item DD: $B \rightarrow D^{(*)}D X$,
        with dominate $D \rightarrow \Kp \mun \neumb X$ sub-decays.
        This is a double-charm ($DD$) control sample,
        which is selected by requiring at least one anti-isolated track,
        a \kaon-like long track\footnote{
            This means the track went through both upstream and downstream
            trackers, and is generally of good tracking quality.
        } and a hard track in the three most anti-isolated tracks\footnote{
            Note that these three requirements can be satisfied by a single
            track.
        }.
