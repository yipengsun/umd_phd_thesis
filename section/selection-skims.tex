\section{Signal (ISO) and control background (1OS, 2OS, DD) skims and the isolation BDT}
\label{ref:sel:skims}

The signal and control skims (sub-samples) are separated by inspecting if there
are additional charged tracks in the event that are likely originating from the
same decay vertex
(typically a $B$ decay vertex, and will be referred as so in later text)
as the reconstructed \DXmu pair;
if there is no such track,
the \DXmu pair is considered \emph{isolated} and is placed in the signal skim;
otherwise it is categorized as one of the control skims.

\paragraph{The isolation BDT}
A multivariate BDT,
referred as the ``isolation BDT'',
conceptually identical to the one used in \cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056},
is trained on LHCb run 2 simulation
with training variables listed in \cref{tab:iso-bdt-input}
to provide a score-based estimation on if a charged track is originating from
the \B (\DXmu) vertex or not.

The isolation BDT is applied on \emph{all recorded} charged tracks in the event,
providing isolation scores for each of them where higher score implies higher
probability of coming from the \B vertex,
referred to as ``anti-isolated''
(Note: ``isolated'' is a property of the \DXmu pair,
while ``anti-isolated'' is a property of the other charged tracks in the
event!).
Three tracks with highest isolation scores
(the ones that are most likely to be anti-isolated)
are saved in descending order\footnote{
    So the first one is the most anti-isolated one among all charged tracks
    in the event.
}.


\paragraph{Skim selection criteria}
A brief description for the signal skim and the main physics background
control skims is provided below.
The dominant decay mode for each skim is also listed; these skims still contain
a composition of many decay modes.
The actual isolation selections are listed in \cref{tab:skim-cut}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ISO:
        Enriched in
        $B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \lepton \neulb$ decays,
        with $\lepton \in \{\muon, \tauon\}$.
        This is referred to as the signal, or the ``isolated'', skim.
        It requires that no additional charged track compatible with coming from
        the \B vertex
        (in a probabilistic sense, with probability related to the isolation
        scores).
        Such requirement translates into a cut on the maximum BDT score:
        $\text{BDT}_1 < 0.15$.
        % TODO: Maybe list yield, and compare to run 1, and include figures?

    \item 1OS:
        Enriched in $B \rightarrow D^{**} \lepton \neulb$.
        This control skim, enriched in excited charm states,
        requires one and only one additional anti-isolated charged long track
        that is compatible with a \pion PID hypothesis and has the correct
        charge for a $D^{**} \rightarrow D^{(*+)}\pim$ decay.

        The BDT score requirements for this skim are:
        $\isoBDT{1} > 0.15$ and $\isoBDT{2} < 0.15$.

    \item 2OS:
        Enriched in $B \rightarrow \Dstst_H \lepton \neulb$,
        where $\Dstst_H$ stands for heavy \Dstst mesons.
        This control skim is enriched in highly excited (heavy) charm states,
        which is selected by requiring two and only two anti-isolated \pion-like
        long tracks of opposite charge,
        capable of $D^{**}_H \rightarrow D^{(*)} \pip\pim$ decay.

        This skim also provides an independent selection of
        $B \rightarrow D^{(*)}D X$ backgrounds
        whose decay products contain many \pion.

        The BDT score requirements are:
        $\isoBDT{1} > 0.15$ and $\isoBDT{2} > 0.15$ and
        $\isoBDT{3} < 0.15$.

    \item DD:
        Enriched in $B \rightarrow D^{(*)}D X$,
        with dominant
        $D \rightarrow \Kp \mun \neumb X$ sub-decays.
        This is a double-charm ($DD$) control sample,
        which is selected by requiring at least one anti-isolated track,
        a \kaon-like long track\footnote{
            This means the track went through both upstream and downstream
            trackers, and is generally of good tracking quality.
        } and a high-\pt track in the three most anti-isolated tracks\footnote{
            Note that these three requirements can be satisfied by a single
            track.
        }.

        The BDT score requirement:
        $\isoBDT{1} > 0.15$
