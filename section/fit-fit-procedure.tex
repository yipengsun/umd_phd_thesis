\section{Fit procedure}
\label{ref:fit:procedure}

The fit procedure is broken into 3 steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pre-control:
        Performed on control samples (1OS, 2OS, DD).
        In this step, all but the \Kstar variations are turned off.
    \item Control:
        Performed on control samples (1OS, 2OS, DD).
        All but the signal and normalization variations are turned on.
        The fitted parameters from previous steps are loaded along with their
        errors as a starting point for the control fit.
    \item Signal:
        Performed on signal sample (ISO).
        The variations for $D^{**}, D_H^{**}$, and misID DiF are loaded as
        constraints to the signal fit;
        the $DDX$ variations are set to constant with fitted value from previous
        step,
\end{enumerate}
