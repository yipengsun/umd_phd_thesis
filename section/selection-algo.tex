\subsection{Veto of overlapping candidates}
\label{ref:sel:algo:veto}

% See this note: https://github.com/umd-lhcb/rdx-run2-analysis/blob/master/docs/cuts/Dst_veto_in_D0.md
Since the selection of a \Dstar\muon pair always requires the existence
of a \Dz\muon pair,
about 21\% of events in the signal (ISO) skim of the \Dstar channel
would contribute to the \Dz channel as well.
% 21 computed as: 630178 (overlap) / 3011082 (num of evt for D0)

% This is likely due to the fact that slow \pion typically has poor tracking
% resolution (small \ipChiSq), making the slow \pion to be more likely
% \emph{unassociated} with the \Dz\mun vertex thus the reconstruction of \Dstar
% would fail.
%
To veto the overlapping candidates between the \Dz and \Dstar channels,
a tool, named \smalltt{TupleToolApplyIsolationVetoDst},
is added to the selection procedure, which loops over each track $t$
in the event whose $p > 2$~GeV in the following manner:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A $\Dz t$ vertex is formed by combining the \Dz track and $t$ with
        a fit.
    \item Compute $\Delta m_\text{veto} \equiv m_{\Dz t} - m_\Dz$.
    \item Test if $\Delta m_\text{veto} \in [140~\text{GeV}, 160~\text{GeV}]$.
        If it is, the track $t$ is able to form a \Dstar-like particle with \Dz.
        Record the $\Delta m_\text{veto}$ and isolation BDT score
        of the track in such a case.
\end{enumerate}

It is required offline (listed in \cref{tab:offline-cut-d0})
that the two most anti-isolated tracks that can form a \Dstar,
the best slow \pion candidates,
are \emph{incompatible} with
forming a \Dz\pion vertex with a mass close to \Dstar reference mass:
$|\Delta m_\text{veto}^\text{candidate 1,2} - 145.454| > 4$~MeV.

Note that this tool does not rank tracks based \emph{solely} on the isolation
score:
the poor tracking resolution of the slow \pion makes the association of
the track more ambiguous;
sometime the track may be better associated with the PV,
instead of the \B vertex,
in which case the track would receive a small BDT score and considered
\emph{not anti-isolated}.
By ranking based on the BDT scores of the tracks that fall within the
$[140~\text{GeV}, 160~\text{GeV}]$
$\Delta m_\text{veto}$ window only,
it is more robust to retain the best slow \pion candidates,
as reported in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056}.

In addition, an alternative mass hypothesis is tested
(offline, also listed in \cref{tab:offline-cut-d0}), where the reconstructed
\muon is treated as a \pion,
and $\Delta m_\text{alt hypo} = m_{\Dz\muon_\text{as \pion}} - m_\Dz$
is computed\footnote{
    By using the 3-momentum of the \muon, while using $m_\pion$ as the invariant
    mass of the track.
} and required to be inconsistent with the difference in \Dstar and \Dz
PDG masses.

The veto procedures are applied on all samples of the \Dz channel only.


\subsection{Muon PID}
\label{ref:sel:algo:ubdt}

To maintain minimum bias on the \muon \pt,
a multivariate BDT,
referred as \UBDT,
using the \smalltt{uBDT} method in the TMVA class,
is trained to reject misidentified \muon while keeping the rejection
efficiency approximately flat on \pt,
as described in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056}.

The \UBDT has been re-trained on LHCb run 2 MC samples.
There is an ongoing effort to study its efficiency against standard run 2 PID
variables.
Early reports suggest the flatness on \pt is maintained while rejection
efficiencies relative to existing PID cut are high for all but protons ($p$),
as shown in \cref{fig:ubdt-eff}.

    \caption{
        Preliminary \UBDT study.
        Left: \UBDT \muon selection efficiency is flat in \pt, with
        global cut \isMuon \& $\text{\PID{\muon}}\! > 2$,
        and $\UBDT > 0.25$.
        Right: with the same global cut, \UBDT is more effective in rejecting
        \pion than LHCb official \ProbNN{\muon}.
        The \kaon rejection efficiencies are similar between the two;
        the $p$ rejection efficiency is lower for \UBDT, but the absolute
        rejection efficiency is high enough.
