The LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider provides a unique opportunity
to study flavor physics with high luminosity.
One topic in flavor physics is
lepton flavor universality (LFU), a property of the standard model (SM) which
requires the three generations of leptons ($e, \mu, \tau$) couple to gauge
bosons of the eletroweak interactions with the same strength.
It is an important probe for testing the validity of the SM and possibly
providing hints to new physics beyond the SM.
This thesis presents a preliminary framework for the measurement of \RDX,
a proxy to test LFU, defined as the ratio
of branching fractions $\BFDTau / \BFDMu$, with LHCb 2016 data.
Another topic of the thesis is the upgrade of the LHCb Upstream Tracker (UT)
which greatly increases the readout rate of the detector and removes
limitations due to hardware trigger,
paving the way for future precision measurements with even higher luminosity.
