I owe my gratitude to all the people who have made this thesis possible.

First, I'd like to thank my advisor, Manuel Franco Sevilla,
for his invaluable advices on my research topics as well as providing enough
freedom for me to explore interesting side projects.

I would also like to thank Phoebe Hamilton for her deep insights on many
problems I ran into.

My colleagues at the Maryland group, notably Alex Fernez and Svende Braun,
as well as Zishuo Yang, Emily Jiang, William Parker, and Abohassan Jawahery,
have provided useful support both on the analysis and hardware,
to which I'm very grateful.

I also want to thank many external collaborators:
on the analysis side Gregory Ciezarek, Lucia Grillo, Simone Meloni,
Julián García Pardiñas, and Patrick Owen---your implementations on similar
problems we ran into provided crucial insights to me.
On the hardware side, I'd like to thank Mark Tobin for his extremely useful
help on the topics related to the LHCb control system.
On the software side, I'd like to thank Dmitry Kalinkin (\smalltt{veprbl}) for
introducing me to \smalltt{nix}, which greatly improved the reproducibility of
this analysis.

Lastly I'd like to thank my family members for being supportive.

It is impossible to remember all, and I apologize to those I've inadvertently
left out.
