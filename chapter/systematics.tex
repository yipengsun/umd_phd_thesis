\chapter{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{ref:sys-uncert}

A breakdown of all evaluated uncertainties is listed in
\cref{tab:sys-uncert}.
The corresponding uncertainties from the run 1 analysis evaluated with
the \HistFactory fitter is also provided as reference.
Not all uncertainties from run 1 are evaluated due to lack of time;
these are omitted from the table.

\begin{table}[htb]
    \caption{
        Evaluated systematic uncertainties.
        Run 1 uncertainties are provided as a reference inside parentheses.
        All uncertainties are absolute, not relative.
        The additive uncertainties are sorted in descending order by their run 1
        significance.
        Currently the MC statistical uncertainties are not taken into account.

The remainder of the chapter is dedicated to explain the evaluation method
for each tabulated systematic uncertainties.
These uncertainties can be loosely classified into the following groups:
Form factors (\cref{sys-ff-d0-dst,sys-ff-dstst}),
under-constrained $\tau$ components (\cref{sys-tau-dstst,sys-tau-ddx}),
uncertainties on the modelling of the background components
(\cref{sys-model-ctrl,sys-model-ddx,sys-model-comb}),
uncertainties on employed algorithms (\cref{sys-algo-misid}),
theoretical corrections not included in the nominal fit
(\cref{sys-theory-coulomb}),
and uncertainties on data/MC corrections
(\cref{sys-cor-vtx,sys-cor-rwt}).
