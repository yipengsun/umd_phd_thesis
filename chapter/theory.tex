\section{Construction of the SM}

Through a close collaboration between experimentalists and theorists,
particle physicists were able to come up with a \emph{quantum field theory}
to describe \emph{interactions} of \emph{elementary particles},
known as the standard model of particle physics (SM).
A construction of the SM is outlined\footnote{
    ``I am an experimentalist!'' says the author waving his hands.
} first with the help of
\cite{Robinson_2011,Schwichtenberg_2018},
followed by brief discussions on quantum eletrodynamics (QED),
    the electroweak theory, and the full SM.

It is experimentally established that the speed of light in vacuum is constant
in any reference frame.
Then, all transformations preserving the speed of light\footnote{
    Each of such transformations, denote as $A$, must leave the Minkowski metric
    $\eta$ intact: $A^T \eta A = \eta$.
} can be identified:
rotations, Lorentz boosts, parity ($\vec{x} \rightarrow -\vec{x}$),
time reversal ($t \rightarrow -t$), and translations.
All but the translation transformations form a group called
``Lorentz group''.
Focusing on the restricted Lorentz group $SO^+(1, 3)$,
which preserves direction of space and time\footnote{
    Loosely speaking, Lorentz group contains 4 ``classes'': $\{I, T, P, TP\}$.
    $SO^+(1,3)$ is the one that contains the identity element.
    The other 3 can be obtained by applying parity ($P$), time reversal ($T$),
    or both ($TP$) to $SO^+(1,3)$.
},
and accepting that it is advantageous to extend $SO^+(1,3)$ to work with vectors
with complex components,
it is shown that the extended group, $SO^+(1,3)_\mathbb{C}$,
contains two copies of $SU(2)_\mathbb{C}$.
% SO+(1,3) = SU(2) x SU(2), direct product

One may ask the following question, then:
``What kinds of object does the group $SO^+(1,3)_\mathbb{C}$ act on?''
To answer this question, the group elements can be represented\footnote{
    With the understanding that any group element $\Lambda$ can be generated
    from 3 rotation generators $\vec{J}$ and 3 boost generators $\vec{K}$
    with the exponential map:
    $\Lambda = e^{i \vec{\theta} \cdot \vec{J} + i \vec{\phi} \cdot \vec{K}}$,
    and the commutation relations between the generators,
    namely $[J_i, J_j], [K_i, K_j], [J_i, K_j]$,
    can be worked out in any representation.
} by $n \times n$ matrices,
and the objects the group acts on by vectors of $n$ complex numbers.
Then the properties of a particular ``representation'' can be studied with
the familiar tool of linear algebra.
As a side note,
$SU(2)_\mathbb{C}$ can be represented by $2j + 1$ dimensional matrices,
where $j$ is a half-integer;
the $j = \frac{1}{2}$ case has 3 Pauli matrices as the group generators.
Since $SO^+(1,3)_\mathbb{C}$ contains two copies of $SU(2)_\mathbb{C}$,
its representations can be labelled as $(j, j')$.
It turns out the answer to the question at the beginning of the paragraph is:
each \emph{irreducible representation}\footnote{
    Roughly speaking, there is no transformation that can simultaneously
    block-diagonalize all matrices representing the group elements.
}
corresponds to a specific type of \emph{elementary particle}.
The $(0, 0)$ representation corresponds to spin-0 scalar particles;
the $(\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $(0, \frac{1}{2})$ representations both corresponds to
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles,
with the former left-handed and the latter right-handed;
the $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) = (\frac{1}{2}, 0) \otimes (0, \frac{1}{2})$
representation corresponds to spin-1 particles.
There are many more irreducible representations,
but in the SM only the spin 0, $\frac{1}{2}$, and 1 particles are present.

Now the SM can be constructed as follows:
First, consider elementary particles with spin $0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$,
which are represented by linear operators in a space:
a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian density\footnote{
    Will be referred as ``Lagrangian'' in later text for brevity.
} can be built from
linear, quadratic, and the lowest possible derivative terms of these
operators.
A Lagrangian built in this manner contains no interaction (i.e. a free
Lagrangian).
Then, require the Lagrangian to be invariant under certain local transformations
such as that from $U(1), SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$.
These requirements can be satisfied by adding/removing certain terms to the
Lagrangian;
these terms make interactions between elementary particles happen.
At this point, there is nothing quantum about the theory.
The theory is ``quantized'' by forcing canonical commutation/anti-commutation
relation for spin-0 and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, respectively\footnote{
    Note that at this point, the terms
    \emph{elementary particles, interactive, and quantum field theory}
    are defined.
}.
Finally, the scattering amplitude from an initial state to a final state,
which is of utmost importance experimentally,
can be computed in a perturbative
manner\footnote{
    To be more precise, the scattering amplitude $\braket{f}{i}$
    between an initial state $\ket{i}$
    and a final state $\ket{f}$
    can be calculated in the following
    manner \cite{Weigand}:
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,nosep]
        \item The amplitude $\braket{f(y_1, \dots, y_r)}{i(x_1, \dots, x_n)}$
            is related to the interactive vacuum
            $\ket{\Omega}$ by the LSZ reduction formula:
            $\braket{f}{i} \propto \bra{\Omega} T \phi(y_1) \dots \phi(y_r) \phi(x_1) \dots \phi(x_n) \ket{\Omega}$,
            where $\phi(x)$, an operator in the Heisenberg picture,
            creates and destroy particles at spacetime point $x$ in the
            interactive vacuum $\ket{\Omega}$,
            and $T$ stands for time-ordering.

        \item Denote the free and the interaction part of the Hamiltonian
            as $H_0, H_\text{int}$, accordingly.

        \item At a given time $t$, a Heisenberg operator and a interactive
            operator are related by
            $\phi(t_0, \vec{x}) = U^\dagger (t, t_0) \Phi_I(t, \vec{x}) U(t, t_0)$,
            where $U(t, t_0) = T e^{-i \int_{t_0}^t H_I(t') d t'}$, and
            $H_I(t) = e^{iH_0(t-t_0)} H_\text{int} e^{-iH_0(t-t_0)}$.

        \item The interactive vacuum $\ket{\Omega}$ and the free vacuum
            $\ket{0}$ are related by
            $\ket{\Omega} \propto \lim_{\tau \rightarrow \infty(1 - i\epsilon)} U(t_0, -\tau)\ket{0}$.

        \item The scattering amplitude can now be written as
            $\braket{f}{i} \propto \bra{0} T \prod_i \Phi_I(x_i) e^{-i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} H_I(t) dt} \ket{0}$,
            where $\Phi_I$ is the $\phi$ operator in the interaction picture
            and has a \emph{free} mode expansion that can create and destroy
            particles in the \emph{free} vacuum $\ket{0}$.

        \item At this point,
            the exponential involving $H_I$ are expanded in a Taylor series:
            $e^{-i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} H_I(t) dt} = \sum_n \frac{(-i)^n}{n!} T\left\{
                \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
                H_{I}^1 \cdots H_{I}^n d t_1 \cdots d t_n
            \right\}$.
            Each term in the series are turned into a series of
            normal-ordered operators with contractions via the Wick's theorem.

        \item The contractions are Feynman propagators with the
            corresponding field operators which are specified by the commutation
            relations between the operators.

        \item The first (non-vanishing) order terms are identified as tree-level
            Feynman diagrams.
    \end{enumerate}
    Higher order terms may involve infinities and require renormalization.
}.


\subsection{Quantum eletrodynamics (QED)}

Following the recipe provided above, first consider all possible terms
in a free Lagrangian for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle,
referred as a (4-component) spinor $\Psi$ in later text.
Noting that parity is conserve in eletrodynamics shown by experiments,
the spinor must contain both left- and right-handed particles:
$\Psi = (\psi_L, \phi_R)^T$,
where $\psi_L, \phi_R$ are 2-component spinor with handedness marked by the
subscript.
