\chapter{Upgrade of the Upstream Tracker}
\label{ref:ut}

Located in the fringing fields in front of the LHCb dipole Magnet,
the Upstream Tracker (UT) plays an important role in improving the tracking
quality and speeding up trigger decisions:
Combining hits from VELO, SciFi, and UT provides the best \pt resolution
and reduce the rate of random combinations from VELO and SciFi to form
ghost tracks to about one fourth.
Furthermore, combining hits from VELO and UT removes low-\pt tracks and narrows
down the hit search window in SciFi, allowing for a faster track reconstruction
which leads to faster trigger decisions.
