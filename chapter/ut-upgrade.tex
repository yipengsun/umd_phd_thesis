\chapter{Upgrade of the Upstream Tracker}
\label{ref:ut}

Located in the fringing fields in front of the LHCb dipole Magnet,
the Upstream Tracker (UT) plays an important role in improving the tracking
quality and speeding up trigger decisions:
Combining hits from VELO, SciFi, and UT provides the best \pt resolution
and reduce the rate of random combinations from VELO and SciFi to form
ghost tracks to about one fourth.
Furthermore, combining hits from VELO and UT removes low-\pt tracks and narrows
down the hit search window in SciFi, allowing for a faster track reconstruction
which leads to faster trigger decisions.

The University of Maryland group is responsible for the design, testing, and
commissioning of the peripheral and power regulating electronics;
An overview of the UT, discussed in \cref{ref:ut:overview},
summarizes the specifications and utilities of these electronics,
together with the sensors.
The author is tasked to test and develop quality assurance procedure for
the Data Control Board (DCB),
part of the peripheral electronics,
which is responsible to concentrate sensor readout and to control the UT
detector;
more details on DCB is described in \cref{ref:ut:dcb}.
In doing so, the author gained understanding on the data acquisition and control
system of the UT;
a review of these systems are summarized in \cref{ref:ut:daq} and
\cref{ref:ut:ctrl}, respectively.


\section{Overview of the UT detector}
\label{ref:ut:overview}

The UT consists of 4 planar detection layers with full LHCb acceptance coverage.
As shown in \cref{fig:ut-layers},
the first and last layers are vertical,
whereas the second and third are rotated by a stereo angle of $\pm 5^\circ$
to form a $x$-$u$-$v$-$x$ configuration.
The vertical planes provide highest hit resolution in the bending plane
($x$-$y$);
the rotated planes provide a measurement in the non-bending direction ($z$).

    }
    \label{fig:ut-layers}
\end{figure}

Each detection layer is made of a number of staves,
a vertical strip of sensors and their readout electronics;
the staves are discussed in \cref{ref:ut:overview:stave}.
The sensor readouts are collected by the electronics hosted inside Peripheral
Electronics (PEPI) crates at the top and bottom of the detection layer,
and are described in \cref{ref:ut:overview:pepi}.
To reduce radiation damage, the low voltage regulators (LVRs),
which supply power to the detector electronics,
are placed further away from the beam at the service bay;
a brief description of the LVR is given in \cref{ref:ut:overview:lvr}.
An overview of the UT exterior is provided in \cref{fig:ut-exterior}.

\subsection{Stave}
\label{ref:ut:overview:stave}

Illustrated in \cref{fig:ut-layers} as a vertical strip,
supported by a carbon fiber core with CO$_2$ cooling pipes,
a stave consists of 4 flexible cables (2 on each side) with sensors and hybrid
readout wire-bonded.
Shown in \cref{fig:stave}, the front and back sensors are mounted with an
overlap to ensure coverage.

There are four types of sensors with different specifications.
The sensors close to the beam pipe (yellow and pink in \cref{fig:ut-layers})
have a finer pitch of 93.5~$\upmu$m and are made with \emph{n-in-p} process for
more radiation hardness,
mainly due to concerns on occupancy and radiation damage.
In addition, the eight half-height sensors (pink) have their strip length halved
to further improve resolution near the beam pipe,
with the four sensors immediately surrounding the pipe having
circular cutouts, instead of rectangular gaps as in TT, to ensure maximum
coverage in the very forward direction.
The outer sensors (green) have a coarser pitch of 187.5~$\upmu$m fabricated with
\emph{p-in-n} technology to reduce cost
\cite{Carli:2783293}.

To minimize the transmission path of the analogue sensor output, readout
SALT ASICs\footnote{
    SALT is developed by the UT collaboration.
    ``ASIC'' stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit.
} are glued to a ceramic stiffener along with a sensor and electronic hybrid
circuit to form a single UT module.
The sensor strips are wire-bonded to the input pins of the SALT\footnote{
    SALT ASICs are represented by small white rectangles in
    \cref{fig:ut-layers}.
}
\cite{Wang:2015mem}.
A sample UT module is shown in \cref{fig:ut-module}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./figs-ut-upgrade/detector/ut_sensor_module.pdf}

        to a type A sensor.

    }
    \label{fig:ut-module}
\end{figure}

Fabricated with TSMC 130~nm CMOS process, SALT is capable of extract, shape,
and digitize analogue signals from the sensor at 40~MHz from 128 channels
simultaneously.
It requires an external 40~MHz clock signal,
which it locks on via a phase-lock loop (PLL),
to work.
It is also capable of generating pseudo-random test patterns on its own without
any excitation on the sensor, which comes handy in testing the data transmitting
quality for the DCB.
As an ASIC, SALT has limited configurability by writing registers via the I2C
protocol \cite{s22010107}.


\subsection{PEPI}
\label{ref:ut:overview:pepi}

Peripheral electronics are responsible for dispatching power to SALTs and
aggregating readout from SALTs to the counting room.
Due to space constraint, power, readout data, and control command dispatch are
all implemented in a board named Backplane which can host up to 12 DCBs.
Each DCB then serialize its data inputs before sending them to the counting
room.
DCB is also responsible for receiving and translating control commands from the
counting room to both itself and SALT ASICs.
In other words, the whole configurable part of the UT detector is exposed as DCB
registers to the counting room.
