\chapter{Event selection}
\label{ref:sel}

This chapter describes the selection procedure for the samples used in this
analysis which involves an online and offline selection.
The initial online selections are a composition of
pre-defined hardware and high-level software triggers provided by the LHCb
experiment;
some of them may be limiting so extra care is needed to avoid biasing important
physical quantities.
The follow-up offline selection requirements are imposed for this analysis
to further separate signal events from various backgrounds.

The events in collision data and MC samples used directly in the fit are
selected with the procedure
described in \cref{ref:sel:data,ref:sel:mc}, accordingly.
Each sample is further divided into signal-like and control background
sub-samples, also known as ``skims''
with the additional requirements listed in \cref{ref:sel:skims}.
The selection of samples used in auxiliary studies is discussed in
\cref{ref:sel:aux}.
Additional algorithms used in the selection process are described in
\cref{ref:sel:algo}.

% CHANGES:
% chapter 5:
%   5.2, define ghost and cocktail
%   all tracks -> long tracks, find the PT requirement
%   remove the 'likely due to ' part in 5.5.2
%   'refit a vertex' -> ?
%   5.5.2 'improved': forget about saving and ntuple stuff.
