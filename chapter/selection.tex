\chapter{Selection}
\label{ref:sel}

This chapter describes the selection procedure for samples used in this
analysis which involves an online and offline selection.
The initial online selection are a composition of
pre-defined triggers and cuts provided by the LHCb experiment;
some of them may be limiting so extra care is needed to avoid biasing important
physical quantities.
The follow-up offline selection are entirely imposed by analysts
to further balance signal selection and background rejection efficiencies
and separate the signal-like sample from various backgrounds.

Most of the samples are directly used in building fit templates;
the selection procedure for these are discussed in \cref{ref:sel:data} and
\cref{ref:sel:mc}.
Selection of samples used in auxiliary studies is discussed in
\cref{ref:sel:aux-study}.
Additional technologies are used in the selection process;
these are described in more details in
\cref{ref:sel:tech}.
