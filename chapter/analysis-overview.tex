\chapter{Analysis overview}
\label{ref:overview}

This analysis aims at an extraction of \RD and \RDst from
LHCb 2016 data\footnote{
    It is planned to use full LHCb run 2 data (2016--2018) at a later date.
}, reconstructed in $\Dstarp\mun$ and $\Dz\mun$ final states.
These states are chosen so that the final state particles
(e.g. $K^-, \pi^+, \mu^-$) are all charged, because the LHCb detector is not
well-suited for neutral particle reconstruction.
A complication of these states is that they are \emph{inhomogeneous},
that is, not all \Dz\mun final state events are actually in \Dz\mun final
states:
\Dstarp\mun states feed down into the \Dz\mun states,
because \Dstarp decays strongly to a \Dz and a slow \pip,
with the latter often missed in the reconstruction;
for example, a slow \pip with a softer momentum may fail to register a
well-defined track in the detector, thus no \Dstarp is constructed for this
event.
In addition, \Dstarz\mun states,
which has a branch fraction of about 2.5 times larger compared to \Dz\mun
states\footnote{
    More precisely, the relevant branching fractions are:
    $\Bm \rightarrow \Dstarz \ell^- \neulb$ and
    $\Bm \rightarrow \Dz \ell^- \neulb$.
},
are contributing exclusively to the \Dz\mun states, because the neutral slow
\piz, a product of \Dstarz decay, is entirely missed.
Therefore, a \emph{simultaneous} fit,
assuming isospin symmetry,
to both \Dstarp\mun and \Dz\mun states is needed to
account for the correlation\footnote{
    \RD and \RDst are considered, however, theoretically uncorrelated.
} between \RD and \RDst due to experimental limitations mentioned above.
