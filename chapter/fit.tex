\chapter{Signal extraction fit}
\label{ref:fit}

To extract \RD and \RDst, the parameters of interest,
a simultaneous \emph{signal fit}
to both \Dz and \Dstar channels with the ISO skim\footnote{
    As a reminder, ``skim'' means \emph{subsample}.
    The selection criteria for all four skims (ISO, 1OS, 2OS, DD) is defined at
    \cref{ref:sel:skims}.
} is performed.
As briefly discussed in \cref{ref:overview},
the parameters responsible for controlling the shapes of the \Dstst and
$DDX$ backgrounds,
such as the \Dstst form factors and $DDX$ Dalitz-inspired shape variations,
are \emph{insensitive} to the signal fit as they constitute only a small
fraction of the ISO data skim.
Therefore these parameters are obtained with a \emph{control fit},
a simultaneous fit to the 1OS, 2OS, and DD control skims with six fit channels
(a \Dz and a \Dstar channel for each control skim),
and imported back to the signal fit at the fitted values with either
fitted errors as constraints (for \Dstst shape parameters) or fully fixed
(for $DDX$ shape parameters).

Both the signal and the control fit are binned extended maximum likelihood
template fits,
with a fitter based on the \HistFactory fitter
used in the pathfinder run 1 \RDX analysis described in
\cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056}\footnote{
    With code refactored and dependencies updated to enhance readability and
    configurability,
    but the fit model is largely the same.
}.
% Fit variables, include binning
The fit templates are three-dimensional correlation-preserving
histograms of \mmSq, \el, and \qSq,
with binning scheme listed in \cref{tab:fit-vars-binning}.
Events outside the binning ranges of the fit variables are cut out to avoid
potential impact of under/overflow bins on the fitter.
To account for external constraints on fit parameters or uncertainties on
modeling of certain backgrounds,
additional shape variations are introduced on most templates
(i.e. all but the \Dstar combinatorial template have some shape variations which
will be discussed later).

% Pointer to later subsections
The remainder of this chapter is organized as following:
% four efficiency ratios to relate the signal yields to the normalization yields
% in both fit channels are introduced in \cref{ref:fit:eff}.
a description on template generation,
followed by a discussion on all components of fit templates,
is described in \cref{ref:fit:tmpl}.
The fit template shape variations are explained in
\cref{ref:fit:var}.
A description on the fit procedure, followed by a detailed dissection of both
the control and signal fit models,
is provided in \cref{ref:fit:procedure}.
Finally, the blinded fitted results are provided in
\cref{ref:fit:results}.
