\chapter{Signal extraction fit}
\label{ref:fit}

The general fit strategy in this analysis is:
First determine control fit parameters related to background processes,
such as $D^{**}$ form factors,
via a simultaneous fit to the 3 control skims
(1OS, 2OS, DD; these skims are discussed in \cref{ref:sel:skims}),
then apply the fitted control parameters and their uncertainties as a
constraint to the signal (ISO) fit
when fitting the remaining parameters, including \RD and \RDst.
Without the help of control skims, the control parameters cannot be determined
from the ISO skim alone precisely,
as these backgrounds are a small fraction of the ISO skim.

Both the control and signal fit are binned extended maximum likelihood template
fit, with a fitter based on the \HistFactory fitter
used in the previous run 1 analysis described in
\cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056}\footnote{
    With code refactored and dependencies updated to enhance readability and
    configurability,
    but the fit model is largely the same.
}.
% Fit variables, include binning
The fit templates are three-dimensional correlation-preserving
histograms of \mmSq, \el, and \qSq,
with binning scheme listed in \cref{tab:fit-vars-binning}.
Events outside the binning ranges of the fit variables are cut out to avoid
potential impact of under/overflow bins on the fitter.
To account for external constraints on fit parameters or uncertainties on
modeling of certain backgrounds,
additional shape variations are introduced on selected templates.
