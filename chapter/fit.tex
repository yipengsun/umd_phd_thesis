\chapter{Signal extraction fit}
\label{ref:fit}

To extract \RD and \RDst, the parameters of interest,
a simultaneous \emph{signal fit}
to both \Dz and \Dstar channels with the ISO skim\footnote{
    As a reminder, ``skim'' means \emph{subsample}.
    The selection criteria for all four skims (ISO, 1OS, 2OS, DD) is defined at
    \cref{ref:sel:skims}.
} is performed.
As briefly discussed in \cref{ref:overview},
the parameters responsible for controlling the shapes of the \Dstst and
$DDX$ backgrounds,
such as the \Dstst form factors,
$DDX$ Dalitz-inspired shape variations,
and the $DDX$ relative fraction correction
(the correction to the relative fraction between the
$\Bzb \rightarrow DDX$ and $\Bm \rightarrow DDX$ templates),
are \emph{insensitive} to the signal fit as they constitute only a small
fraction of the ISO data skim.
As an example,
Allowing the $DDX$ relative fraction correction to float in the signal fit
seemingly improves the fit quality,
as shown in \cref{fig:fit-float-uvsd},
but one of \RDX is pushed to 0.
This suggests that the $DDX$
(sometimes referred to as $DD$ in the subsequent text) components can completely
absorb the signal if their parameters are not well-constrained.

        Only the \Dstar channel fit is shown as it shows the most improvements
        in terms of pulls.

Therefore, these background shape parameters are obtained with a
\emph{control fit},
a simultaneous fit to the 1OS, 2OS, and DD control skims with six fit channels
(a \Dz and a \Dstar channel for each control skim),
and imported back to the signal fit at the fitted values with either
fitted errors as constraints (for \Dstst shape parameters) or fully fixed
(for $DDX$ shape parameters).
To be more precise,
the fit procedure is broken into 3 steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pre-control}:
        Performed on control skims (1OS, 2OS, DD).
        In this step, all but the \Kstar shape variations are turned off.
    \item \textbf{Control}:
        Also performed on control skims (1OS, 2OS, DD).
        All but the signal and normalization shape variations are turned on.
        The fitted parameters from previous steps are loaded along with their
        errors as a starting point for the control fit.
    \item \textbf{Signal}:
        Performed on signal sample (ISO).
        The variations in the control fit for $D^{**}, D_H^{**}$, and misID DiF
        are loaded as constraints to the signal fit;
        the $DDX$ variations are fixed to the fitted value from the previous
        step.
\end{enumerate}
The terms such as ``\Kstar variations'' and ``misID DiF'' will be defined later.

Both the signal and the control fit are binned extended maximum likelihood
template fits,
with a fitter based on the \HistFactory fitter
used in the pathfinder run 1 \RDX analysis described in
\cite{LHCb-ANA-2020-056}\footnote{
    With code refactored and dependencies updated to enhance readability and
    configurability,
    but the fit model is largely the same.
}.
% Fit variables, include binning
The fit templates are three-dimensional correlation-preserving
histograms of \mmSq, \el, and \qSq,
with binning scheme listed in \cref{tab:fit-vars-binning}.
Events outside the binning ranges of the fit variables are cut out to avoid
potential impact of under/overflow bins on the fitter.
To account for external constraints on fit parameters or uncertainties on
modeling of certain backgrounds,
additional shape variations are introduced on most templates
(i.e. all but the \Dstar combinatorial template have some shape variations which
will be discussed later).
