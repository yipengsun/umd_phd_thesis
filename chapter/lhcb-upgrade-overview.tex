\chapter{Overview of the LHCb upgrade}
\label{ref:lhcb-upgrade-overview}

% General changes
The run 2 of LHC has reached its conclusion at the end of 2018.
It has entered the second long shutdown (LS2) period since then.
During this period,
the upgrade on the LHC has enabled the accelerator to operate at
an unprecedented center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$~TeV with an
instantaneous luminosity of $2 \times 10^{33}$~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ (a five-fold
increase compared to run 2's number)
\cite{CERN_news:2022,Piucci_2017}.
As of now\footnote{
    As a reminder, ``now'' refers to November 2022.
}, some of the LHCb subdetectors, for example the Upstream Tracker, are still
being upgraded.
